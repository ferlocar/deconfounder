# Deconfounder Tree

This repository contains the source code for a tree-induction algorithm that may be used to learn a tree that corrects for confounding (i.e., a deconfounder tree). 
The deconfounder tree is learned through a combination of observational and experimental data, and the intent behind the tree is to correct for unobserved confounding bias 
in causal-effect models. This project is still under development, but the 'examples' folder contains some illustrations 
of how the deconfounder tree may be used to improve treatment assignments.
